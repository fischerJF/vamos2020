// Interface CharSequenceTokenizerSource
//

/**<p>
 * Extension of the {@link TokenizerSource} interface and the {@link java.lang.CharSequence}
 * interface that was introduced in J2SE 1.4. The <code>CharSequence</code>
 * interface provides a safe way to access character data for reading without 
 * exposing internal buffers or copying. The drawback is that it is only available
 * with Java versions from 1.4, while there are still lots of Java 1.3 and even
 * older environments in use.
 *</p><p>
 * While implementations of this interface can be used by all {@link Tokenizer},
 * specialized tokenizers can take advantage of the generally faster methods 
 * provided by the <code>CharSequence</code> interface.
 *</p>
