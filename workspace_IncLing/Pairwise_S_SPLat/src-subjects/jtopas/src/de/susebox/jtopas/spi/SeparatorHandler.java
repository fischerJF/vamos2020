// Interface SeparatorHandler

/**<p>
 * This interface declares the methods a {@link de.susebox.jtopas.Tokenizer} needs
 * to deal with separators.
 *</p><p>
 * Separators are single characters that are either not very important in the 
 * tokenizing process or are sufficiently characterized by their token image. 
 * Examples are opening and closing parentheses, commas, semicolons etc. Their 
 * main feature is that they separate other tokens in the same way as whiterspaces
 * and comments.
