// Interface Flags
//

/**
 * The interface defines flags that are used by various classes during tokenizing.
 * A flag can be set in three ways:
 *<ul><li>
 *    Globally for a {@link TokenizerProperties} object: The setting affects all
 *    {@link Tokenizer} instances that share this <code>TokenizerProperties</code>
 *    object as well as the {@link TokenizerProperty} objects registered in this
 *    <code>TokenizerProperties</code> that do haven't set the flag locally.
 *</li><li>
 *    Separately for a {@link Tokenizer} (see {@link Tokenizer#changeParseFlags}: 
 *    A single <code>Tokenizer</code> will behave differently to the setting in
 *    the used {@link TokenizerProperties} object, but still follow the setting
 *    for a single {@link TokenizerProperty} object. Only a limited number of
 *    flags can be set for a <code>Tokenizer</code>, especially the flags that
 *    are "dynamic", applicable more for the tokenizing process than describing
 *    an attribute of a {@link TokenizerProperty}, e. g. {@link #F_COUNT_LINES} 
 *    and {@link #F_KEEP_DATA}.
 *</li><li>
 *    Specifically for a single {@link TokenizerProperty}: This setting affects
 *    only the handling of the property and overrules both settings for the
 *    {@link TokenizerProperties} that contains the property, and settings for a
 *    {@link Tokenizer} using the <code>TokenizerProperties</code> object. Only
 *    a limited number of flags can be set for a singel property including the
 *    descriptive flags like {@link #F_NO_CASE}, {@link #F_ALLOW_NESTED_COMMENTS}
 *    and {@link #F_SINGLE_LINE_STRING}.
 *</li></ul>
